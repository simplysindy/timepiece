# Luxury Watch Price Prediction System

A complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting luxury watch prices. This system scrapes real-time data from WatchCharts.com, engineers 80+ features, and trains multiple forecasting models to predict price movements across premium watch brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simplysindy/timepiece.git
   cd timepiece
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   **conda**
   ```bash
   conda create --name timepiece python=3.11
   conda activate timepiece
   ```
   
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîß Quick Start

Run the complete pipeline in sequence, or execute individual stages as needed.

### 1. Scrape Watch Data
```bash
python -m src.scraper.scraper
```
Discovers and scrapes price data from WatchCharts.com for 10+ luxury brands. Saves individual watch CSV files under `data/watches/`.

### 2. Prepare ML Dataset
```bash
python -m src.data_prep.data_prep
```
Processes raw data into ML-ready format with 80+ engineered features. Outputs to `data/processed/`.

### 3. Train Prediction Models
```bash
python -m src.training.training
```
Trains multiple algorithms on temporal splits. Models and predictions saved to `data/output/models/`.

### 4. Generate Predictions
```bash
python -m src.inference.inference
```
Uses trained models to generate forward-looking price predictions.

### 5. Interactive Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run src/inference/streamlit_app.py
```
Launch web interface to explore predictions, visualize trends, and analyze model performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All pipelines use Hydra for configuration management. Customize behavior via CLI overrides:

```bash
# Run scraping with custom settings
python -m src.scraper.scraper scraping.headless=false discovery.target_count_per_brand=5

# Train only specific models and horizons
python -m src.training.training training.models=["lightgbm","xgboost"] training.horizons=[1,7]

# Customize feature engineering
python -m src.data_prep.data_prep features.include_technical=false processing.outlier_method=zscore
```

Default configurations are in `conf/*.yaml` files.
